IDO/ICOs allow you to purchase large quantities of coins/tokens at a very low price. Your investment will rapidly increase in value as the project gains traction and more use cases are identified.

## Mine Cryptocurrency

Mining cryptocurrency is another established method of earning money. This, however, is not a free service. To begin mining cryptocurrencies, you'll need mining equipment, which can be quite expensive and can consume a lot of power.

Isn't that quite lucrative?

## Staking and Lending

Generally, staking is an ideal long-term form of investment for crypto holders, who want stable gains while minimizing risk. If you lack the appetite for high-risk activities such as day-trading, derivatives, this option may be for you. You can become a [liquidity provider](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider) on a platform that facilitates lending and borrowing of digital assets, such as [Aave](https://aave.com) or [Compound](https://compound.finance).
